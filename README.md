# Airbnb Data Analysis for Mexico

## 1. Background and Overview

**Context:**

The short-term rental market in Mexico is experiencing significant growth, offering lucrative opportunities for Airbnb investors. However, choosing the right city and property type can be a complex task. This project aims to provide data-driven insights to help individual investors make informed decisions in this competitive market.

**Objective:**

This analysis focuses on identifying key factors for successful Airbnb investments in Mexico. The specific goals are:

1.  **Identify the Most Profitable Cities:** By analyzing revenue performance across different regions, we aim to pinpoint the cities that offer the best returns for Airbnb investors.
2.  **Rank Property Types by Revenue Potential:** Help investors understand which types of listings generate the highest returns in specific locations.
3.  **Evaluate Pricing Strategies:** To optimize earnings, considering factors like nightly rates, fees, and location-based performance.

## 2. Data Structure Overview

**Geographic Coverage:**

The dataset includes Airbnb listings from various cities across Mexico, though it does not encompass all available properties. This limits the analysis to a subset of the market.

**Time Frame:**

The data begins from March 2025 onwards, capturing the most recent market trends for short-term rentals in Mexico.

**Available Features:**

* **Location Data:** Information on city, latitude, and longitude, allowing for geographic performance analysis.
* **Pricing Information:** Data on nightly rates, fees, and discounts associated with each listing.
* **Property Type:** The type or category of rental unit, enabling an analysis of how different property types perform.

**Limitations:**

* **Lack of Occupancy Data:** The dataset does not include occupancy rates, so demand is approximated using review counts. This may not fully capture actual demand.
* **Absence of Seasonal Data:** Without seasonality data, trends may not account for fluctuations due to holidays or travel seasons.
* **Limited Property Details:** Missing information like number of rooms, bathrooms, and amenities reduces the depth of analysis and prediction accuracy.

![Dashboard SS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccada154-ea64-433b-b245-9bec73547826)

* Nightly Rates and Gross Price are the most significant drivers of Estimated Monthly Earnings, indicating the importance of competitive pricing.
* Certain cities, like Tulum and Brisas De Zicatela, offer the highest returns on investment, driven by both pricing and property type.
* Fees, including Fee Total and Fee Airbnb, are correlated with higher earnings, but their impact is secondary to pricing factors.
* Discounting and ratings have minimal influence on earnings, suggesting that focusing on competitive pricing is the most effective strategy.

## 4. Insights Deep Dive

**Profitability Analysis by City:**

* Cities like Tulum, Brisas De Zicatela, and El Pescadero are top performers, with high revenue potential across various property types.
* Hotel, Loft, and Place properties consistently underperform, indicating that they may be less competitive in terms of profitability.
* The lack of occupancy data limits our ability to fully gauge demand, but review counts serve as a proxy for demand levels.

**Pricing Strategy Impact:**

* Nightly Rates and Gross Price are highly correlated with monthly earnings. Properties with higher pricing perform better in terms of revenue generation.
* The relationship between fees and earnings, though positive, is less significant than that of pricing. This suggests that, while Airbnbâ€™s fees do influence profitability, pricing remains the key factor in earnings.

**Fees, Discounts, and Reviews:**

* Discount Amount and Ratings show negligible correlations with earnings. Discounting and high ratings do not appear to significantly affect profitability.
* Reviews show a weak negative correlation, but it does not offer predictive value in terms of earnings.

## 5. Recommendations

1.  **Focus on Competitive Pricing:** Investors should prioritize setting higher nightly rates and gross prices, as these factors are the strongest predictors of profitability.
2.  **Optimize Property Type Selection:** Home, Apartment, and Guesthouse properties are the most profitable. Consider investing in these types for higher returns.
3.  **Minimize Discounting:** Given that discounts show no significant correlation with earnings, investors should avoid heavily discounting properties unless necessary to remain competitive in specific markets.
4.  **Monitor Fees and Gross Prices:** While fees do have a moderate positive correlation with earnings, the main focus should remain on setting competitive and premium pricing for optimal returns.
